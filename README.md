So I think about creating a BINGO game that show all the years and the winners of this combitions from it's beginnig in 1930 until this version 2022 (22 times + 2 times cancelled)
I created a fake API for the years and the winners, to consult it you can visite the link [API World Cup](https://tahiriabdo131.github.io/fake-api-world-cup-winners/winners.json).

- You can have multiple bingos

### More details

### Tools
